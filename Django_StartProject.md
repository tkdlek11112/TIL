# Make a Login API with Django.

Sometimes, I used Django to make a restful-API server or a simple homepage. But I don't know Django deeply. So, I'm about to start Django.

My first project is Login API with Django. It manage all customers and login authentication. The reason why I pick this project is involved my blog.
I wroth some posts help makeing a login function by using php/mysql for android. Many people ask some question to me about it.
It doesn't work! How Can I do?. 

I realized that some people face many ploblems while following the step to make server. I mean, there are many different development enviroments, program versions and so on.
So I decided to make a program which is easy to use. As I know, Django make a database itself seeing I wrote the config-file.

## Make a first Django project.

Install python and pyCham is a IDE to development python project. Also I make a AWS account to run my own virture environment.
My mac mini can run a server, but it's a chance to use(and learn) AWS.
