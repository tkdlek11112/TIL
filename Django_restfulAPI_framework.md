# Django REST framework [Link](https://www.django-rest-framework.org)

Already there are many framework or lib for making restfulAPI with Django. One is `Django REST framework`.

## Install django rest framework
It's easy to install. Just click Link, follow example. done!

## Make admin(superuser)
To login by admin, I should make an admin account. As write python manage.py 
createsuperuser at console window, I can make admin account.

## Finish install and I wonder how it works.
