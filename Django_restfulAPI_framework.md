Already there are many framework or lib for making restfulAPI with Django. One is `Django REST framework`.

## Install django rest framework
It's easy to install. Just click Link, follow example. done!

## Make admin(superuser)
To login by admin, I should make an admin account. As write python manage.py 
createsuperuser at console window, I can make admin account.

## Finish install and I wonder how it works.

Should I use restfulAPI?.. is not.  RestfulAPI is a design for easy developing and maintaining. But some system are not suitable. Let me do restfulAPI for my Login API Server.

## Create New Project

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate

2. Install Django and utility
    pip install django
    pip install djangorestframework
    pip install pygments -- it's a highlight tool
